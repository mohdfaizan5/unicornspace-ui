## Understanding the need for Guardrails?
Basically AI can generate anything wrong and aslos the user can leak any sensitive data(such as IP's, passwords, CC, API keys) to the LLM. This becomes a huge problem in Enterprise as the company doesn't want to leak their data.Guardrailsai.com
So there should be some way to protect it.

We now intercept the input and output and add Guardrails that filters out such stuff.

<Mermaid chart="

  A([User]) --*1* Sensitive data--> B([LLM])
  B --**2** Inappropriate response --> A
"/>

So now at level `1` and level `2` we introduce 
1. Input Guardrails
2. Output Guardrails

## Input Guardrails

{/* TODO: check inapproproiate spelling */}
<Mermaid chart="
flowchart LR
  A(Inpure Input) --> B([1. Reject Inppropriate prompt])
  B x--x C([2. Reject personal Info])
  C x--x D([3. Mask information])
  D --> E(Pure Input)
 "/>

## Output Guardrails

* Use an another LLM to as a `Judge` for the output it the LLM responds

```bash title="example system prompt for output guardrails LLM"
You're a helpful Assistent that acts like a judge, you'll be given the prompt of the user and the response from the LLM.
Your job is to judge it and give a score out of 10.
