# Forms

- they have benefits of progresive enhancement and works even if js is not loaded in browser and the final js bundle size is minimal
- Also they stack up (bundle) the similar requests in made in many place making it 1 req.

1. Revalidate function

## useFormStatus

> Note make sure you're extracting this into a seperate file, extracted from you your server form component.

```tsx
const { pending } = useFormStatus();
return (
  <Button disabled={pending} type="submit" className="w-full">
    // Adding a spinner if pending is true
    {pending && <RotateCw className="animate-spin mr-2" size={15} />}
    {actionType === "add" ? "Add a pet" : "Edit pet"}
  </Button>
);
```

## useTransition

to get pending state outside of form(unlike useFormStatus()) and add loading state to UI

> There are downsides of it but we can use it in server actions

```tsx
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

<Button
  disabled={isPending}
  onClick={async () => {
    startTransition(async () => {
      await deletePet(selectedPet.id);
    });
  }}
>
  Checkout
</Button>;
// now we can access the pending state for server actions outside of form
```


## react-hook-form

### Triggers

- We can use triggers instead of handle submit to check validation in form

```tsx
useForm;
```
