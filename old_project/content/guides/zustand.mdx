# Zustand

Zustand is a small unopinionated state management library built by Jotai and React-spring.  It is a great alternative to Redux and MobX.

## Installation

```terminal
pnpm install zustand
```

### 1. First create a Store
The first step is to create a store using the create function from Zustand. This store will manage the state and functions related to state.

- Create a folder named **Store** and add a **file.tsx** with the following code inside it.

```tsx
import {create} from 'zustand'

export const useCounter = create((set:any) => ({
  count: 0,
  incrementCount: () => set((state:any) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
  decrementCount: () => set((state:any) => ({ count: state.count - 1 }))
}))

```
- See that the **create** function, passes a **set** function to the callback function. This set function is a function used to manipulate the state in the store
- In our above example, we have three states in our store: **count**,  **incrementCount** ,and **decrementCount** . The **useCounter** is a custom hook, we can use this hook in our components and we will be able to get the latest state in them. If we use the hook in components A, B, and C. Any change done to the state in B will be reflected in both A and C, and they will all re-render to reflect the new changes.

### 2. Then bind your components

- Once the store is created, you can use it in your React components. The store functions as a hook, and you can select specific pieces of state or functions that your component needs.

```tsx
"use client"

import {useCounter} from '@/store/zustand'

function Counter() {

  const {count,incrementCount,decrementCount} = useCounter((state:any)=>(
    {
      count:state.count,
      incrementCount:state.incrementCount,
      decrementCount:state.decrementCount,
    }
  ))

  return (
    
    <div>
      Counter: {count}
      <button className='border-2 border-black  px-2 m-5  ' onClick={incrementCount} >Increament</button>
      <button className='border-2 border-black  px-2 m-5  ' onClick={decrementCount} >Decreament</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Counter
```
