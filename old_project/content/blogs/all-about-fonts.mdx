## Font Types vs. Font Formats

Let's break down the difference between font types and the various font formats you mentioned.

### Font Types

These refer to the overall design and style of a font, such as:

- **Serif fonts:** Have small lines (serifs) at the end of each letterstroke. Examples: Times New Roman, Garamond.
- **Sans-serif fonts:** Lack serifs. Examples: Arial, Helvetica.
- **Script fonts:** Mimic handwriting. Examples: Calligraphy Script, Brush Script.
- **Decorative fonts:** Often have unique and artistic styles. Examples: Blackletter, Stencil.
- **Monospace fonts:** All characters have the same width. Examples: Courier New, Consolas.

### Font Formats

These are the file types used to store font data.

- **TrueType Font (TTF):** One of the oldest font formats, widely supported.
- **OpenType Font (OTF):** More advanced than TTF, supports complex typographic features.
- **Web Open Font Format (WOFF):** Compressed version of TTF or OTF, optimized for web use.
- **Web Open Font Format 2 (WOFF2):** Newer version of WOFF, offering even better compression.
- **Embedded Open Type (EOT):** Older format, primarily used for Internet Explorer compatibility (less common now).
- **Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG):** Vector-based format, often used for icons but can also be used for fonts.

**Key Differences:**

- **Font types** define the appearance of the font.
- **Font formats** determine how the font data is stored and delivered.

**Why use different formats?**

- **TTF and OTF:** Versatile for print and digital use, widely supported.
- **WOFF and WOFF2:** Optimized for web use, faster loading times.
- **EOT:** Primarily for legacy browser support.
- **SVG:** Used for vector-based fonts, often for icons or specific design needs.

**In summary:**
When selecting a font for a project, consider both the font type (appearance) and the font format (how it's delivered). For web use, WOFF2 is generally the preferred format due to its superior compression and performance.
