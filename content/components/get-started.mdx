title: Getting started
description:
  Focus on what matters, not UI, boilerplate code, clumsy documentation. Leave that on us. Get inspired, plan, create great web pages
  with designs and components that you can copy and paste directly into
  your apps.

UnicornSpaceUI is a collection of reusable components that you can copy
and paste into your web apps.

## Why we started this

Our goal for the project is to `save your time`, as 90% of the time you'll be using components and designs that are similar to what you or others on the internet have built previously. Then why should you waste your time reinventing the wheel?

## Where will UnicornSpaceUI help you & save your time?

- You no longer need to go in search of inspiration, going through tens of websites to find it; we’ve got it all here.
- You no longer need to go through clumsy documentation to figure out how to integrate auth, payments, technologies, and much more. Instead, use our easy-to-follow [/guides](/guides).
- We're saving your time from finding designs for inspiration to selecting good fonts, colors, and layouts to building the product and optimizing it for production.
- We've got a bunch of tools to help you fast-track your workflow in design and development.
- This is a perfect place for you in case you lack design skills; we've got you covered. You can learn design, typography, UI, and UX principles, along with tried-and-tested UI to get things to function.
- And much more...

## Whom is this UnicornSpaceUI for?

1. SAAS owners
2. Individual Developers
3. Indie Hackers
4. Companies looking to pace up
5. Developers who lack design skills.

## Why did we start?

There are lots of `UI libraries` out there, but we believed there is a lot to be covered, and they have missed out. They might be good for foundations, but in real life, things are just beyond that basic UI. You need better design, better layouts, and faster growth. You don't want to get stuck in the repetitive parts; you just want to get things done and work on the crux of the problem you're trying to solve.

## Who are we?

We are a team from [UnicornSpace](https://www.unicornspace.tech/). On a daily basis, we have gone through these problems ourselves, and that is why we built UnicornSpaceUI to fix this.

## We're inspired by
