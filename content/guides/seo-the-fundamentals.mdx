## What is SEO

## Why do we need SEO in the first place?

- In this world where competion is at it's peak, everyone is looking to see your attension
- to get organic i.e free traffic(customers) to our brand/website with spending on CAC(Customer Acqisition Cost)

> The best place is hide a deadbody is googles 2nd page, because no one goes there

## How can I go about it.

## Search Engines

- Google
- bing

## How Crawlers work?

## Technical SEO

The SEO that is done on the code side of the page is called technical SEO, like on HTML tags, all all the other stuff on tech side of web page

<Diagram
  code={`graph TD
A(SEO) --> B(Technical SEO);
A --> C(Sementic SEO);
A --> D(OnPageSEO);
A --> E(OffPageSEO);
`}
/>

# Nextjs 15 - SEO

Here's the cleaned and corrected Markdown:

````markdown
## Favicon

Place it in root src directory

Use [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net) for .ico generation

## Opengraph Image (Global)

That's the image shown when you paste the link in social media

```tsx
src / app / opengraph - image.png;
```
````

> Recommended size (1200x630 px)

## Base Metadata

```typescript
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Default template title for child pages",
  twitter: {
    card: "summary_large_image",
  },
};
```

- We can host our localhost online by using:

1. socialsharpreview.com
2. open graph analyzers

## Dynamic Metadata

```typescript
export async function generateMetadata(params: {
  postId: string;
}): Promise<Metadata> {
  // Fetch post data
  return {
    title: post.title,
    description: post.body,
    openGraph: {
      images: [post.thumbnailUrl],
    },
  };
}

const getPost = cache(async (id) => {
  // Fetch post logic
});
```

> Manually deduplicate requests if not using ISR

- If you put "opengraph-image.png" in a specific route/dynamic, it will overwrite base opengraph image
- You can also dynamically generate OG images
  Ref: documentation

## Static Rendering

> Loading is bad for SEO

- After building, if a page is static, even if you have a request to now data, it doesn't work as it has fetched during compile (build) time & cached

```typescript
export const generateStaticParams = async () => {
  const posts = getPosts();
  return posts.map((post) => ({ id: post.id }));
};
```

_This returns a list/array which tells Next.js to load them & then cache them (which will make them good for performance)_

- What if during build time you don't have that data/slug (as you might have lately added that to the DB)? Next.js is smart here - first time when someone visits that slug, it takes time to render (slow), once after that it caches it & then it takes less time
- `notFound()` pages are essential because they provide accurate data to crawlers

## Server & Client Components

_We've to make sure we render as much as possible on server components, but in case we need interactivity (client components), then we make sure it is as less as possible and try using leaf components as small as possible_

Example:

- If a button needs interactivity, then only the button should be a client component, rest should be server components

## Sitemap

This tells the crawler what pages are contained in your project/website

```tsx:src/app/sitemap.ts
import { navigation } from "@/config/navbar";
import { allBlogs } from "contentlayer/generated";
import type { MetadataRoute } from "next";

const WEBSITE_URL = "https://ui.unicorn-space.com";

export default function sitemap(): MetadataRoute.Sitemap {
  const blogs: MetadataRoute.Sitemap = allBlogs.map((blog) => {
    return {
      url: `${WEBSITE_URL}${blog.slug}`,
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: "yearly",
      priority: 0.7,
    };
  });

  let tools_temp = navigation.find((nav) => nav.title === "Tools");

  let tools;
  if (tools_temp) {
    tools = tools_temp.links.map((tools) => {
      return {
        url: `${WEBSITE_URL}${tools.href}`,
        lastModified: new Date(),
        changeFrequency: "monthly",
        priority: 0.9,
      };
    });
  }

  const otherPages = [
    "/components/get-started",
    "/showcase",
    "/changelog",
    "/blog",
    "/components",
    "/guides",
    "/tools",
  ];

  return [
    {
      url: `${WEBSITE_URL}`,
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: "yearly",
      priority: 1,
    },
    ...otherPages.map((page) => {
      return {
        url: `${WEBSITE_URL}${page}`,
        lastModified: new Date(),
        changeFrequency: "monthly",
        priority: 0.9,
      };
    }),


    ...blogs,
  ];
}

```

## Robots.txt

This tells the crawler what to crawl & what not to crawl

> Note: Visit [sitemap](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap) for more information

```tsx:robots.txt
import { MetadataRoute } from "next";

export default function robots(): MetadataRoute.Robots {
  return {
    rules: [
      {
        userAgent: "*",
        allow: "/",
      },
    ],
    sitemap: "https://ui.unicorn-space.com/sitemap.xml",
  };
}

```

## Structured Data Markups
