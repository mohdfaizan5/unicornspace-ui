# UploadThing

UploadThing is a package used to add file uploads to your full stack TypeScript application. In this guide you will learn how to upload images inn your next.js application.

## Installation

Note:
{/* Use uploadthing official documentation for the latest version installation. [uploadthing](https://docs.uploadthing.com/getting-started/appdir) */}

```bash
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/react
```

## Pre-requisites

You need to sign-in using github account. Because you require env variables from uploadthing.
Once it's done, you can also view all your uploads in the uploadthing dashboard.
[uploadthing signin](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)

## Add env variables

Copy API keys from uploadthing > dashboard and paste into **.env** file.

## Creating your first file route

The following is a very minimalistic example, with a single FileRoute "imageUploader". It has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed
  To get full insight into what you can do with the FileRoutes. Refer this [docs](https://docs.uploadthing.com/api-reference/server#file-routes)

> File path - app/api/uploadthing/core.ts

```ts
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/next";
import { UploadThingError } from "uploadthing/server";

const f = createUploadthing();

const auth = (req: Request) => ({ id: "fakeId" }); // Fake auth function

// FileRouter for your app, can contain multiple FileRoutes
export const ourFileRouter = {
  // Define as many FileRoutes as you like, each with a unique routeSlug
  imageUploader: f({ image: { maxFileSize: "4MB" } })
    // Set permissions and file types for this FileRoute
    .middleware(async ({ req }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(req);

      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new UploadThingError("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      console.log("file url", file.url);

      // !!! Whatever is returned here is sent to the clientside `onClientUploadComplete` callback
      return { uploadedBy: metadata.userId };
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof ourFileRouter;
```

## Create a Next.js API route

> File path - app/api/uploadthing/route.ts

```tsx
import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/next";

import { ourFileRouter } from "./core";

// Export routes for Next App Router
export const { GET, POST } = createRouteHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,

  // Apply an (optional) custom config:
  // config: { ... },
});
```

## Add Styles

Add the below snippet in your **tailwind.config.ts** file (or) Wrap your Tailwind config with the `withUt` helper.
Learn more about Tailwind helper & configuration in [theming docs](https://docs.uploadthing.com/theming#with-tailwindcss)

```ts
import { withUt } from "uploadthing/tw";

export default withUt({
  content: [
    // Your existing Tailwind config
  content: ["./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,mdx}"],
  ],
});

```

## Create The UploadThing Components (Recommended)

You can import the components individually from `@uploadthing/react` instead.

> File path - src/utils/uploadthing.ts

```tsx
import {
  generateUploadButton,
  generateUploadDropzone,
} from "@uploadthing/react";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "@/app/api/uploadthing/core";

export const UploadButton = generateUploadButton<OurFileRouter>();
export const UploadDropzone = generateUploadDropzone<OurFileRouter>();
```

## Mount A Button And Upload!

Create a component seperately as this needs to be a client component and will contain the code to upload images.
You can also customize the `UploadButton` to `UploadDropzone` to get a dropzone area instead of a button...

```tsx
"use client";

import { UploadButton } from "@/utils/uploadthing";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <UploadButton
        endpoint="imageUploader"
        onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
          console.log("Files: ", res);
          alert("Upload Completed");
        }}
        onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
          alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```
