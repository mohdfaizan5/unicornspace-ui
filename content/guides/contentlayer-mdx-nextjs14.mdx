## Nested lists

1.  **Nested lists are rarely a good idea.**
    - Nested navigation in UIs is a bad idea too, keep things as flat as possible.

- **But in this second top-level list item, they will.**

  This is especially annoying because of the spacing on this paragraph.

  - As you can see here, because I've added a second line, this list item now has a `<p>` tag.

    This is the second line I'm talking about by the way.

- A closing list item, but with no nested list, because why not?
