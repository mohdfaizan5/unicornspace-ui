## What is Native Wind?

Native Wind is a utility-first CSS framework for React Native. It allows you to use Tailwind CSS classes in your React Native projects, making it easy to style your components using a familiar syntax.
Native Wind is built on top of React Native's built-in styling system, so you can use it alongside your existing styles. It also provides a set of utility classes that you can use to quickly style your components without writing custom styles.
